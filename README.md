# Capstone Project

## Introduction

We have covered data literacy, data analysis, data engineering, and data science throughout this course. Now, we're asking you to demonstrate your understanding of those concepts in your capstone project.  

This is a group project, and the instruction team will assign you to your groups.  

This is your final project, and there will be no resubmissions at the end. For that reason, we will be grading each section as you complete it throughout the week.  

Your mission:  

- Your group is preparing to enter the field in a particular industry. We want you to explore at least three datasets related to the industry where you will be working.
  - If your industry is unknown, your instructors will assign you an industry for this assessment.
- When exploring these datasets, you should come up with 5-10 questions about data in your industry. Once your questions are approved, you can bring in additional data to help answer those questions.
  - You can exclude data sources as well - but at least one Census dataset must be used.
- You will present your findings in a few methods of delivery:
  - A dashboard - using Dash or Power BI with Python
  - An executive summary
  - A project presentation
